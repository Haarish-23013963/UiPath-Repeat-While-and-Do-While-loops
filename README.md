# EXP-3 Flow sequenceusing Repeat, While and Do-While loops
### NAME: HAARISH V
### REG NO: 212223230067

This repository contains a simple UiPath workflow that demonstrates the use of different looping activities:

 - Repeat
 - While
 - Do While

## Project Overview
 - Built using UiPath Studio
 - Demonstrates iteration and looping constructs
 - A basic learning project for understanding how loops work in UiPath

## Project Files
 - Main.xaml → Flowchart connecting all loop demos
 - Repeat_Demo.xaml → Demonstrates Repeat Number of Times
 - While_Demo.xaml → Demonstrates While loop
 - DoWhile_Demo.xaml → Demonstrates Do While loop
 - project.json → Project configuration
 - screenshots/ → Auto-generated by UiPath (if any)

## Workflow 
### 1. REPEAT NUMBER OF TIMES
### Output:

### 3. DO WHILE LOOP
### Output:
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (7)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/049a01db-c576-4095-b6a5-62e9f1531316" />

## Result
Thus the workflow sequence using Repeat, While and Do While Loops are executed successfully.
